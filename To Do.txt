TO DO:
Enemy - Need standarized enemycontroller type. Righthow everything is hardcoded to use BlobControllers.

Blob - OnTriggerExit: Stop following?
     - Speed up / Slow down like player

RigidBody2D - Move away from using Unity Phyics

Player - Pressing opposite directions should stop the player
       - Shooter should assign damage to bullet (based on player's runes)
       - Figure out if you want to do melee or ranged (or both)

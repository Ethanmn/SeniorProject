Work on rune choice and making that fun

Paper prototype

Game plan:
Have an interface at the beginning that tells you about your character (attributes), maybe a selection of 3 characters
Interface for choosing a weapon
Interface for choosing runes
Interface for choosing items
Run through a dungeon

MAYBE have them go through the process again?

One of the rooms doesn't have wall colliders

Need:
"Holes" in the walls
ESW1 North exit broken (as in there shouldn't be one)
ESWR
NS1 (EW wall holes)
NSR?

Root room (empties/exits)
Dungeon exits
Game over / You're Winner!
UI For runes
Mini-map
Death (throws errors, messes up heart UI)
Add reset

Mobs need to be standardized better so raising "onKill" events happens as they are dissabled rather than when their health reaches 0 (Gemini can reach <= 0 health and still not be "killed", we don't want them to be farmed)

Lance should re-calculate damage
Bow needs a chage UI piece

Fix Gemini to not give charges until actually dead

Fletcher buff doesn't work with UI

Playtesting notes:
Reduce num runes from 9 to 5
Adjust the text to better explain max runes
Move mobs away from door when re-entering
Orb re-charge rather than reload?
Add sound, music, etc

Mini-map
Double rune is currently useless
Stats page
Restart without closing
Clarity in writing (eg patience = not attack? not move? rate? mischivous - Flinch time is what? Vorpal - 8 seconds means what?)
Bow needs to be able to shoot faster (Feels hard to hit) Needs UI piece
Denote catagories of traits
Randomization issues (Not let it select it same triat two times)
Profession that increases the number of runes?
mischivious -> mischievous
garunteed -> guaranteed

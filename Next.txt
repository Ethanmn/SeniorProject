Work on rune choice and making that fun

Paper prototype

Game plan:
Have an interface at the beginning that tells you about your character (attributes), maybe a selection of 3 characters
Interface for choosing a weapon
Interface for choosing runes
Interface for choosing items
Run through a dungeon

MAYBE have them go through the process again?

One of the rooms doesn't have wall colliders

Need:
Root room (empties/exits)
Dungeon exits
Game over / You're Winner!
UI For runes
Mini-map
Death (throws errors, messes up heart UI)
Add reset

Lance should re-calculate damage
Bow needs a chage UI piece

Fix Gemini to not give charges until actually dead

Fletcher buff doesn't work with UI

Playtesting notes:
Reduce num runes from 9 to 5
Adjust the text to better explain max runes
Move mobs away from door when re-entering
Orb re-charge rather than reload?
Add sound, music, etc

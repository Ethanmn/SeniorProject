Work on rune choice and making that fun

Paper prototype

Game plan:
Have an interface at the beginning that tells you about your character (attributes), maybe a selection of 3 characters
Interface for choosing a weapon (or random?)
Interface for choosing runes
Interface for choosing items
Run through a dungeon

MAYBE have them go through the process again?

Need:
Gemini - Original spawns a twin
Root room (empties/exits)
Dungeon exits
Descriptions for each attribute
Interfaces (obviously)

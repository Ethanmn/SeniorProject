Work on rune choice and making that fun

Paper prototype

Game plan:
Have an interface at the beginning that tells you about your character (attributes), maybe a selection of 3 characters
Interface for choosing a weapon
Interface for choosing runes
Interface for choosing items
Run through a dungeon

MAYBE have them go through the process again?

One of the rooms doesn't have wall colliders

Need:
Root room (empties/exits)
Dungeon exits
UI For runes
Descriptions for each attribute
Interfaces for choosing stuff(obviously)
Mini-map
Death (throws errors)
Move enemies away from exits
Fix Gemini to not give charges until actually dead

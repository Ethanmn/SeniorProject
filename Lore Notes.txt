Lore notes
- "The Architects"
- The Architects created the world when there was nothing but light. Using patterns of light they designed a world full of beautiful land and life. They infused the land with their powers and light. The power can be drawn from the world in the form of Patterns (or runes). The Architects watched over the land from the Evermaze, a construct of matter light that continually shifted and reformed over the years, bending to the Architects' wills. But as humans began to understand the Patterns that ruled their world they grew greedy with power, feeling that they no longer needed the Architects. Thus began the Thousand Year War.
